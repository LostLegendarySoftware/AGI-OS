# Technical Research for Ternary CPU Kernel Stub Development

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates essential technical research for developing a bootable kernel stub with ternary CPU and IPC capabilities. The research covers UEFI boot requirements, ternary computing fundamentals, kernel IPC patterns, and NixOS build configurations to inform the kernel architecture design.

## 1. UEFI Boot Process Requirements

### 1.1 Entry Point Specifications
- **Mandatory Entry Point**: Kernel must provide an EFI boot stub entry point as the first code executed after UEFI firmware loads the kernel image
- **Direct Boot Capability**: Support for booting without conventional bootloaders (like GRUB) through direct UEFI firmware loading
- **Target Architecture**: x86-64 UEFI systems support required

### 1.2 Memory Initialization Requirements
- **Basic Hardware Initialization**: Perform minimal hardware setup during boot process
- **Identity Memory Mapping**: Create minimal identity memory mapping for initial kernel execution
- **Global Descriptor Table (GDT)**: Configure GDT for proper memory segmentation
- **Memory Management**: Implement initial memory allocation and mapping capabilities

### 1.3 C Programming Requirements for UEFI
```c
// Required includes and entry point structure
#include <Uefi.h>

EFI_STATUS EFIAPI efi_main(
    EFI_HANDLE ImageHandle,
    EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE *SystemTable
) {
    // Kernel initialization logic
    return EFI_SUCCESS;
}
```

### 1.4 Build Requirements
- **64-bit Linking**: Link against `crt0-efi-x86_64.o` and `libgnuefi.a`
- **Linker Script**: Use `elf_x86_64_efi.lds` linker script
- **GNU-EFI Library**: Utilize GNU-EFI library for UEFI development
- **System Interaction**: Use `EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE` for system interactions and `SIMPLE_TEXT_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL` for console output

## 2. Ternary Computing Fundamentals

### 2.1 Core Characteristics
- **Base-3 Logic**: Uses three states (-1, 0, 1) instead of traditional binary (0, 1)
- **Computational Efficiency**: More efficient computation compared to binary systems
- **Compact Representation**: Allows for more compact information representation

### 2.2 Instruction Format Design
- **Register Addressing**: 27 registers require 3 trits of address per register
- **Instruction Encoding**: Potential for 18-trit instruction encoding enabling dense 3-address instruction formats
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Requires specialized logic for ternary arithmetic operations

### 2.3 Virtual CPU Implementation Strategy
- **Three-State Logic Operations**: Implement execution loop handling three-state logic
- **Instruction Decoding**: Develop efficient instruction decoding for ternary logic
- **Register Design**: Create register and memory addressing schemes compatible with base-3 system
- **Execution Cycles**: Manage complex execution cycle for three-state operations

### 2.4 Reference Implementation
- **SBTCVM**: Open-source virtual machine for balanced ternary computing provides practical reference
- **Balanced Ternary**: Uses voltage-based implementation with negative voltage, positive voltage, and ground

## 3. Kernel IPC Implementation Patterns

### 3.1 Message Queue Architecture
- **Kernel Space Implementation**: Message queues reside in kernel address space as linked lists
- **Unique Identification**: Each message queue identified by unique message queue identifier
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Support for asynchronous communication between processes
- **Fixed-Size Messages**: Enable transmission of fixed-size data items

### 3.2 Communication Mechanisms
- **Synchronous Message Passing**: Copy-based message passing with kernel as intermediary
- **Connection Models**:
  - Connection-based: Fixed recipient specification
  - Connectionless: Per-send operation recipient specification
- **Thread and ISR Support**: Allow threads and interrupt service routines to send/receive messages

### 3.3 Memory Boundary Enforcement
- **Kernel-Mediated Communication**: All communication passes through kernel for security
- **Controlled Data Transfer**: Prevent direct memory access between processes
- **Memory Allocation Management**: Kernel manages memory allocation and message routing

### 3.4 Data Structure Implementation
- **Ring Buffers**: Circular buffer with fixed-size memory allocation for efficient producer-consumer scenarios
- **Atomic Operations**: Thread-safe communication using atomic read/write operations
- **Shared Memory Integration**: Ring buffers can be implemented in shared memory regions
- **Sequence Tracking**: Track producer and consumer positions using sequence numbers

### 3.5 Advanced IPC Features
- **POSIX IPC Support**: Implement streams, datagrams, and shared memory interfaces
- **Multithread Communication**: Support for concurrent thread communication
- **High-Performance Design**: Optimize for high-throughput scenarios with proper synchronization

## 4. NixOS Build Configuration

### 4.1 Flake Configuration Structure
```nix
{
  description = "Ternary CPU Kernel Stub";
  
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  };
  
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... }@inputs: {
    # Cross-compilation configuration
    # Kernel build parameters
    # Bootable image generation
  };
}
```

### 4.2 Cross-Compilation Setup
- **Platform Awareness**: Configure both build platform and target platform using `nixpkgs.crossSystem`
- **Toolchain Configuration**: Set up cross-compilation GCC toolchain for target architecture
- **Build Dependencies**: Manage architecture-specific build dependencies
- **Emulation Support**: Use `boot.binfmt.emulatedSystems` for multi-architecture support

### 4.3 Image Generation Capabilities
- **nixos-generators**: Flexible image generation for various target systems
- **Cross-Architecture Support**: Build support for x86_64, aarch64, ARM architectures
- **EFI Boot Support**: Essential for modern system compatibility
- **Custom Kernel Integration**: Careful dependency management for custom kernel parameters

### 4.4 Development Environment
- **Isolated Environments**: Use `nix develop` for isolated development environments
- **Reproducible Builds**: Leverage flake.nix for consistent, reproducible build configurations
- **Toolchain Management**: Utilize `nix-shell` for flexible toolchain environments
